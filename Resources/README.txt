Description:
	Branch:
		PS6 is basically PS5 with a GUI put on top.

	Menu Selection:
		From the file menu selection, you can perform four operations.

                1.	New will create an entirely new spreadsheet window.
					It can be accessed with the shortcut Ctrl+N.

                2.	Open will bring up a dialog box to load any .sprd file into your spreadsheet.
					It can be accessed with the shortcut Ctrl+O.
					There will also be a check if loading a new file will overwrite any changes to your current spreadsheet.

                3.	Save will bring up a dialog box to save your spreadsheet as a .sprd file to a given directroy. 
					It can be accessed with the shortcut Ctrl+S.

                4.	Close will close your current spreadsheet window.
					It can be accessed with the shortcut Ctrl+W.
					There will also be a check if closing the current spreadsheet will result in any lost data.

        You may also access a webpage at anytime with the Help->Website menu selection.
        It can be accessed with the shortcut F1.

    Selecting Cells:
        You can select cells using your mouse as well as your keyboard.

        With a mouse, just simply click on a cell to select it.
        With your keyboard, you can use the arrow keys, Enter to go down, Tab to go right, and Shift+Tab to go left.

    Editing Cells:
        You can edit cells at anytime by simply typing whatever you want to be in the cell.
        When you select another cell by clicking, tabbing, ext. the cell will be evaluated.

        Cells can hold numbers, words, as well as formulas in the form: =3+5
        That cell will then display the value 8, but you may edit the formula anytime you wish.

    Possible Errors:
        Message boxes will pop up whenever you encounter a possible error.
        The messages will give you details on the solution to the error.

                "Unable to save file." 

					 You might have tried to overwrite the spreadsheet into an incompatible file type.

                "Unable to load specified file." 

					You might have tried to load a file that didn't have a .sprd extension or is corrupt.

                "A circular dependency occurs when this action is performed!" 

					A circular dependency is when a formula relies or eventually relies on its own value for calculation.
					An example may be the cell A1 containing the formula = A1.

                "Formula is incorrectly formatted. Please check syntax for any errors." 

					Your formula contained incorrect syntax. Variable names can only be cell name references such as a letter
					followed by an integer. The notations are infix and use *, /, +, -, (, and ).
